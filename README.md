    <h2> What is ADHD?</h2>
    <p>Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (<em>ADHD</em>) is a developmental disorder that includes a combination of 
    impulsive behaviors, difficulty concentrating, excessive restlessness, having trouble with self control, even causing brain fogs. 
    Let's us break down each words specifically to better understand them. <strong>Attention Deficit</strong> Deficit means the lack of, 
    therefore the lack of attention, while the term <strong>Hyperactive</strong> means excessive in therms of movement, fidgetting, tapping,
     or even whistling excessively is above normal. <strong>Disorder</strong> I used to hate this term, but understanding it can lead to 
     acceptance. The prefix, "Dis" means apart while Order means structure. Disorder means a normal functioning is 
     disrupted by a constant stream of restlessness, fidgetting, impulsive behaviors that impact the way the brain 
     function and impact our daily life. </p>
